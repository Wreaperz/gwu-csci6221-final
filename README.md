**Project Concept:** _Encrypted Two-Way Radio_

**Project Details:**

    Project Issue: 
    
      Two-way radios are a staple form of communication in remote areas, or in situations where 
      handheld phones are too delicate (construction sites, etc.). However, these types of radios offer no privacy, 
      and allow anyone to listen in on conversations. This project aims to resolve that issue by performing live encryption 
      on the audio data being transmitted between devices (prior to transmission), 
      and then performing live decryption and playback of that audio.
